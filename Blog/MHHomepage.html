            <section id="additionalinfo">
                <p>The <strong>Miami Heat</strong> are an American professional basketball team based in Miami. The Heat compete in the <strong>National Basketball Association (NBA)</strong> as a member of the <strong>Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference.</strong> The club plays its home games at Kaseya Center, and has won three NBA championships.

                    The franchise began play in the 1988 to 89 season as an expansion team. After a period of mediocrity, the Heat gained relevance in the mid-1990s when <strong>Pat Riley</strong> became team president and head coach. Riley constructed the trades for <strong>Alonzo Mourning</strong> and <strong>Tim Hardaway</strong>, which propelled the team into playoff contention. Mourning and Hardaway led the Heat to four consecutive division titles prior to their departures in 2001 and 2002, respectively. The team also experienced success after drafting <strong>Dwyane Wade</strong> in 2003.

                    Led by Wade, following a trade for former NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) <strong>Shaquille O'Neal,</strong> the Heat won their first <strong>NBA title in 2006,</strong> after Riley named himself head coach for a second stint. After the departure of O'Neal two years later, the team struggled for the remainder of the 2000s. Riley remained team president, but was replaced as head coach by <strong>Erik Spoelstra.</strong> In 2010, the Heat signed reigning league MVP <strong>LeBron James</strong> and NBA All-Star <strong>Chris Bosh,</strong> creating the <strong>"Big Three"</strong> along with Wade. During their four years together, Spoelstra, James, Wade, and Bosh led the Heat to the NBA Finals in every season, culminating in back-to-back championships in <strong>2012 and 2013.</strong> All three departed by 2016, and the team entered a period of rebuilding. After acquiring All-Star <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong> in 2019, the Heat returned to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023. The Heat acquired six-time NBA All-Star <strong>Kyle Lowry</strong> in 2021.

                    <br>
                    The Heat hold the record for the <strong>NBA's third-longest winning streak, 27 straight games,</strong> set during the 2012 to 13 season. 
                    <br>
                    <strong>Six Hall of Famers</strong> have played for Miami, and James won two consecutive NBA MVP Awards while playing for the team.

                    <p><strong>Miami Heat,</strong> American professional basketball team based in <strong>Miami</strong> that plays in the Eastern Conference of the <strong>National Basketball Association (NBA).</strong> The Heat have won three NBA championships <strong>(2006, 2012, and 2013).</strong> The Heat, along with the <strong>Charlotte Hornets,</strong> entered the league in 1988 as an expansion team.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The 2006 NBA Finals was the championship series of the 2005–06 NBA season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The <strong>Dallas Mavericks</strong> were favored to win the championship over the <strong>Miami Heat.</strong> Despite these odds, the Heat won the title in six games over the Mavericks, becoming the third team—after the 1969 <strong>Celtics,</strong> the 1977 <strong>Trail Blazers</strong> and later the 2016 <strong>Cleveland Cavaliers</strong> and 2021 <strong>Milwaukee Bucks</strong>—to win a championship after trailing 0–2 in the series. <strong>Dwyane Wade</strong> of the Heat was named Most Valuable Player of the series.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The 2012 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2011–12 season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs, contested between the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat defeated the Western Conference champion Oklahoma City Thunder. It was played from June 12 to 21, 2012. 
                        Led by the <strong>"Big Three"</strong> of season MVP <strong>James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh,</strong> the Heat defeated the Thunder in five games. The Thunder, led by three future MVPs in <strong>Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden,</strong> had home-court advantage, and won Game 1 before the Heat won the next four games to clinch their second title in history. The win by the Heat earned James his first championship. James was also named the Finals MVP.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The 2013 NBA Finals was the championship series of the <strong>National Basketball Association's (NBA)</strong> 2012–13 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs, played from June 6 to 20, 2013. The defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion <strong>Miami Heat,</strong> who were favored to win the series, defeated the Western Conference champion <strong>San Antonio Spurs</strong> in seven games to win their third championship.
                        The <strong>Miami Heat's</strong> league-best regular season record of 66–16 gave them home-court advantage against the <strong>San Antonio Spurs,</strong> who finished the regular season 58–24. The <strong>San Antonio Spurs</strong> won the opening game on the road and eventually took a 3–2 series lead before the <strong>Miami Heat</strong> won the remaining two games at home to win their second consecutive NBA title. <strong>LeBron James,</strong> who was named the season MVP, was also named Finals MVP for the second straight year. The Heat's late rally in Games 6 and 7, which also included <strong>Ray Allen's</strong> clutch 3-pointer in Game 6 to force overtime, has made it one of the greatest Finals of all time.</p>
